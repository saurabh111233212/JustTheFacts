// 1. The Supreme Court issued an order that stops violent criminals and individuals who are not allowed to have guns from evading a federal law that requires background checks for gun purchasers.
// 2. The case, referred to as Garland v. VanDerStok, is about "ghost guns", disassembled firearms sold in ready-to-assemble kits.
// 3. Generally, the law necessitates anyone buying a gun to undergo a background check and for firearms to have a trackable serial number.
// 4. The law applies to any weapon that can be converted into a device that expels a projectile, including the frame or receiver of such a weapon.
// 5. Ghost guns are typically sold as kits, containing gun parts that can be assembled into a functional firearm.
// 6. The kits occasionally include an incomplete frame or receiver, which can often be easily completed.
// 7. Judge Reed O’Connor ruled that these ghost gun kits do not require a background check or serial numbers.
// 8. Reed O'Connor argued that weapon parts are not considered "weapons" but only a complete firearm is.
// 9. O’Connor's decision was temporarily paused by the Supreme Court.
// 10. The Court’s order in VanDerStok temporarily prevents O’Connor from setting nationwide gun policies.
// 11. The decision in VanDerStok involves Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump-appointed conservative judge, who provided the fifth vote.
// 12. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another appointee of Trump, and Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented.
// 13. The Supreme Court's decision suspends O'Connor's order until the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, reviews the case.

// 1. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of enforcing the regulations on "ghost guns" by a 5-4 vote.
// 2. These regulations were instigated by the Biden administration.
// 3. This decision was only temporary whilst a lawsuit against the said regulations is still ongoing in lower courts.
// 4. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett were conservatives who aligned with the court's three liberals for this verdict.
// 5. The arrangement focused on kits used to create homemade firearms, known as "ghost guns" which possess no identifiable serial numbers.
// 6. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives established rules on these "ghost gun" kits last year, necessitating serial numbers and mandating sellers to monitor transaction records and conduct buyer background checks.
// 7. These regulations were opposed via a lawsuit by a company that sells firearm components as well as pro-Second Amendment groups.
// 8. The plaintiffs argued that the ATF broadened the definition of a firearm beyond their capacity.
// 9. Judge Reed O’Connor, a conservative in the Northern District of Texas, put a national halt on these regulations in the previous month.
// 10. The Biden administration requested the Supreme Court to revive these regulations on an emergency appeal.
// 11. The case is now sent back to the lower courts for the regulations' legal scrutiny to be continued.
// 12. Supporting the majority verdict were Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson.
// 13. On the dissenting side were Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh.
// 14. The final verdict was not explained by either the majority or the dissenters, which is a standard trait for court orders on the "shadow docket."
// 15. The ruling enforcing the ATF rule was applauded by supporters of stricter gun control.
// 16. The ATF received over 45,000 reports of suspected "ghost guns" retrieved by law enforcement from 2016 to 2021, with 700 instances related to homicide or attempted homicide cases, according to a Department of Justice statement.

// 1. The Supreme Court has temporarily revived the Biden administration's regulation of homemade, untraceable firearms known as "ghost guns".
// 2. The regulation in question is a part of President Biden's broader efforts to address gun violence.
// 3. The decision from the Supreme Court was on a 5-4 vote.
// 4. The regulation, issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in 2022, expanded the interpretation of the term "firearm" in the Gun Control Act of 1968.
// 5. The regulation requires manufacturers and sellers of gun kits and components to obtain licenses, mark their products with serial numbers, and conduct background checks.
// 6. The regulation has been challenged by gun owners, advocacy groups, and companies that manufacture or distribute gun kits and components, stating that it is not authorized by the 1968 law.
// 7. Judge Reed O’Connor of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas sided with the opponents of the regulation and dismissed it in July.
// 8. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans refused to stay key aspects of Judge O’Connor’s ruling.
// 9. There is disagreement between the government and the challengers on whether there has been an increase in the use of ghost guns in crimes.
// 10. The government claims that crimes involving ghost guns have surged, while the challengers disagree with this assertion.
// 11. According to an official from the A.T.F., over 19,000 firearms without serial numbers were recovered by authorities in 2021, compared with about 1,600 in 2017. They added that around 23,452 suspected privately-made firearms were recovered at crime scenes and submitted for tracing in the 11 months ending in July.
// 12. The ghost guns can be assembled from kits purchased online by anyone with basic tools and rudimentary skills in a short time period, as mentioned by the government officials.

// https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66365642
// 1. The regulations on non-traceable "ghost guns" will continue while the White House is appealing against a court ruling.
// 2. A Texas court in July blocked a 2022 rule that mandates self-built "ghost gun" kits to have serial numbers.
// 3. Pro-gun rights organizations had launched a lawsuit to prevent the legal classification of "ghost guns" as a firearm.
// 4. The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on Tuesday lets the restrictions persist during the legal challenge.
// 5. The so-called "ghost guns" can be self-assembled and at times 3D printed, making them potentially lack serial numbers and hard to track.
// 6. The new rules by the Biden administration, which were developed to control the spread of "ghost guns," were implemented in August.
// 7. According to U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor's ruling in Texas, the Biden administration exceeded its authority under the 1968 Gun Control Act by categorizing "buy build shoot" kits as firearms.
// 8. The White House claims that fast action against unregistered weapons is vital, as 20,000 presumed ghost guns were discovered in criminal investigations in 2021.
// 9. Americans have more firearms per person than any other nation, having more guns in civilian control than the country's citizens.
// 10. Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that more than 48,800 Americans died due to gun injuries in 2021.
// 11. The Supreme Court's rulings in recent years have typically broadened individual gun rights, such as a ruling last year that protected the individual's right to carry handguns in public for self-defense.
// 12. In its next session starting in October, the court will consider a case about whether people with domestic violence restraining orders can keep their firearms.
// 13. Due to disagreements in Congress regarding gun control, President Biden and Democrats are using alternatives to federal laws to reinforce gun restrictions.
// 14. These alternatives include executive actions like ghost gun rules and laws enacted at state and local levels, predominantly in regions where Democrats hold the majority.
